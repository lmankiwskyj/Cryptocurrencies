The data set was processed to fit the machine learning models. 
  - Null data points were removed
  - Only includes cryptocurrencies that are currently being traded and have mined coined 
  
 Unsupervised learning was used since there is no known output.
  - Created variables for the text features with get_dummies()
  - The features were standardized using the StandardScaler fit_transform() function
  - Used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, the dimensions were reduced to three principal components 
 
 Then grouped with a clustering algorithm. 
  - Used the K-means algorithm hvPlot to find the best value for K
